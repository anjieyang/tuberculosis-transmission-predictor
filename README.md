1. k_means.py: the codes for k means. it still needs some improvment in the programming structure
2. hierarchical.py: the codes for hierarchical clustering. there are some mistakes in this file, and the computational complex is high, which means running it is very time-comsuming. So there is also much room for improvment.
3. visualization.py: to color the maps.
