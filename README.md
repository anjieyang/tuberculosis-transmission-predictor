1. k_means.py: the codes for k means. it still needs some improvment in the programming structure
2. hierarchical.py: the codes for hierarchical clustering. there are some mistakes in this file, and the computational complexity is high, which means it is very time-comsuming to run. So there is also much room for improvment.
3. visualization.py: to color the maps.
